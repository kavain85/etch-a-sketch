# Etch-A-Sketch

A project for The Odin Project.

Goal:
- To create a web-based etch-a-sketch game using what I have learned about JS and DOM manipulation
- The grid for "drawing" will be created by the script itself, and not hard-coded on the page
- User will be able to select grid size, pen color, eraser, as well as reset the grid
